# Changelog

## Head

- Support for React 16, using `ReactDOM.createPortal` if it's available.

## 2.2.1

- Ensure npm publication of `dist/`.

## 2.2.0

- Add `WrappedComponent` static property.

## 2.1.4

- Introduce `dist/displace.js`, where `src/` now compiles to, since React 15.5+ demands `class`es, so Babel-compilation.
  Which is actually a huge overhaul, though in semver it's just a patch.

- Clean up anonymous container `<div>` when unmounting.

## 2.0.1

## 2.0.0

## 1.0.1

## 1.0.0
